# Week 2 – Insurance Fraud Detection  

This project applies **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** to detect fraudulent insurance claims.  
It was developed as part of my MSc coursework in Data Mining.  

## Files  
- `src/Claims.py` → Python implementation of SVC model  
- `data/Claims.csv` → Dataset of insurance claims  

## Key Learnings  
- Understanding **regularization in SVC**  
- Detecting **insurance fraud patterns** using machine learning  
- Model tuning and evaluation  

## How to Run  
```bash
python src/Claims.py
