# Week 1 – Churn Prediction  

This project predicts **customer churn** using:
- Logistic Regression  
- AdaBoost Classifier  

### Files
- `ChurnPrediction.csv` → Dataset  
- `ChurnPrediction_LR.py` → Logistic Regression model  
- `ChurnPrediction_AdaBoost.py` → AdaBoost model  
- `.gitignore` → Ignore unnecessary files  
- `README.md` → Project documentation  

### Overview
The project was developed as part of my **MSc Business Analytics coursework (Data Mining module)**.  
It compares Logistic Regression and AdaBoost models to classify churn and evaluate performance.  

### Results
- Logistic Regression: Baseline accuracy & interpretability  
- AdaBoost: Boosted performance with better handling of misclassified cases
