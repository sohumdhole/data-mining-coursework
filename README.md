# Churn Prediction – Week 1

This project predicts customer churn using **Logistic Regression** and **AdaBoost** classifiers.  
It was developed as part of my MSc coursework in Data Mining.  

## Files
- `src/ChurnPrediction_LR.py` → Logistic Regression model  
- `src/ChurnPrediction_AdaBoost.py` → AdaBoost model  
- `data/ChurnPrediction.csv` → Dataset used for training/testing  

## Key Learnings
- Applying supervised learning models to real-world churn data  
- Comparing ensemble methods with baseline classifiers  
- Evaluating model accuracy and insights  

## How to Run
```bash
python src/ChurnPrediction_LR.py
python src/ChurnPrediction_AdaBoost.py
```
